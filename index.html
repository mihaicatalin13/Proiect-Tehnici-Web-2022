                <p>"<b>Chess</b> is a board game played between two players. It is sometimes called Western chess or
                    international
                    chess
                    to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi and shogi. The current form of the game emerged
                    in
                    Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from chaturanga, a similar
                    but
                    much older game of Indian origin. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by
                    millions
                    of people worldwide.

                    Chess is an abstract <b>strategy game</b> and involves no hidden information. It is played on a
                    square
                    chessboard
                    with <b>64 squares</b> arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player (one
                    controlling
                    the <b>white
                        pieces</b>, the other controlling the <b>black pieces</b>) controls sixteen pieces: <b>one king,
                        one
                        queen,
                        two rooks,
                        two
                        bishops, two knights, and eight pawns</b>. The object of the game is to <b>checkmate</b> the
                    opponent's
                    king,
                    whereby
                    the king is under immediate attack (in "check") and there is no way for it to escape. There are also
                    several
                    ways a game can end in a draw.

                    Organized chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is governed internationally by
                    <b>FIDE
                        (International Chess Federation)</b>. The first universally recognized World Chess Champion,
                    Wilhelm
                    Steinitz,
                    claimed his title in 1886; Magnus Carlsen is the current World Champion. A huge body of chess theory
                    has
                    developed since the game's inception. Aspects of art are found in chess composition, and chess in
                    its
                    turn
                    influenced Western culture and art and has connections with other fields such as <b>mathematics,
                        computer
                        science, and psychology</b>.

                    One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine. In 1997, Deep
                    Blue
                    became the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry
                    Kasparov.
                    Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players, and have deeply
                    influenced
                    the
                    development of chess theory." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess, 2022)
